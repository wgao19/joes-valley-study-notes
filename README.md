# Joe’s Valley

This is a personalized study notes of _Joe's Valley_. I am a software engineer visiting SLC for React Rally this August. Off the time of my coding I am also a climber. Long story short I am preparing a side trip to Joe's Valley. 

As a climber I am doing 6b's on lead, and V3/4's on bouldering. With a recent focus on bouldering, Joe's Valley is such an interesting spot to experience. I have no prior experience for outdoor bouldering so this study notes will come from that perspective -- basics, safety, trip preparation, etc.

I wish this set of notes will help myself throughout this trip and hopefully more people like me in the future.

## To Begin With...

I talked to a few people regarding how to boulder outdoors and here are some valuable tips that I learned: 

> Spotters are important. Climb with good partners who care about what you are doing.

I definitely agree with this throughout my other climbing. But due to the nature of this trip, I'll make friends along my way.

> Find the easiest boulders with good landing to begin with.
