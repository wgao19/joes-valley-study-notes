# Joe’s Valley

This is a personalized study notes of _Joe's Valley_. I am a software engineer visiting SLC for React Rally this August. Off the time of my coding I am also a climber. Long story short I am preparing a side trip to Joe's Valley. 

As a climber I am doing 6b's on lead, and V3/4's on bouldering. With a recent focus on bouldering, Joe's Valley is such an interesting spot to experience. I have no prior experience for outdoor bouldering so this study notes will come from that perspective -- basics, safety, trip preparation, etc.

I wish this set of notes will help myself throughout this trip and hopefully more people like me in the future.

I did not include the source of friends / gyms I got help from in this writeup for I am personally quite private and I extend the assumption here. If anyone I mention here would prefer a reference, please let me know and I am more than happy to add you to the list :) :)

# To Begin With...

## Words of Advice from Senpais

I talked to a few people regarding how to boulder outdoors and here are some valuable tips that I learned: 

> Spotters are important. Climb with good partners who care about what you are doing.

I definitely agree with this throughout my other climbing. But due to the nature of this trip, I'll make friends along my way.

> Find the easiest boulders with good landing to begin with.

This motivates one of the following sections. I put an effort in trying to find those easy problems with good landing.

> I would probably not begin with somewhere like bishop, where the boulders are really high, even if it is very well-known.

OK, fair enough. I was hella scared the first time I did outdoor sport climb as well. I definitely would not go somewhere that high.

## Silly Questions of Mine

Should I look for a way down first before climbing up every boulder?

How tall is Isaac Caldiero (author of the guidebook)?

# Bouldering at Joe's

## By Region

a.k.a. guidebook reading

I found two sources of guides for Joe's Valley. One is a guidebook (see book reference #1) I borrowed from a friend, a route setter / gym manager at one of our local gyms, also a v10 or plus climber, who happens to have climbed at Joe's Valley a few years back. The other one is drtopo's free guide, which can be downloaded [here](http://www.drtopo.com/north-america/united-states/utah/joe-s-valley).

As I read the two guides side by side, I found it very helpful to try to match the descriptions from the two guides. With this problem-solving and/or fact-finding approach it absorbs me quite effectively, making it easy to get familiar with the material and the surrounding it's describing.

The two materials also complements each other very well as in the book contains pictures of the boulder, I can see whether it has a safe landing. The book's description of the beta is also in more detail. I can get a fairly good understanding what kind of boulder problem it is, so that I might (or not) have a rough idea whether it fits my style or not.

On the other side, the printed guides I would just feel free to write and mark anything on it. The drtopo's guide contains fewer problems (but perhaps those are the highlights) than the book. I put the page mark beside each problem. If it's something below V3 with a seemingly safe landing, I highlight it with a marker.

I am going there at a fairly hot season (mid of August). So I also try to figure out which side the boulder is facing and whether it has shades.

### Left Fork

### Right Fork

#### Warm Up Area

This is the region on the Right Fork closest to the parking spot. Some classic easy problems such as _Better Than Coffee_, _Standard Overhang_, and _Todd's Easy Arete_, etc, are there.

How does _Better Than Coffee_ get its name? There's also a _Better Than Starbucks_ near it. I'm assuming it's saying it wakes you up better than coffee? There is a YouTube video for it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeYBE6N5GEs), looks fun. Though the two guides disagree on its difficulty. Most say it's a V4 but drtopo says it's a V1. Only one way to know~
